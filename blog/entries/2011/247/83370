DMZ Volume 7
<p>
  Ended up waking up late, spending a long time getting out of bed (ah, the
  infinite joys of a wonderful primary), eating a light breakfast, and then
  spending the day with <a href="http://lulabs.net/">kalenedrael</a>, an old
  friend (no known PGP key). We wrote code together - I've always found it
  easier to write code when there are others writing code in the vicinity -
  then played <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Commander_%28video_game%29">
  Supreme Commander</a>, at which we were soundly thrashed by the AI.
  Afterwards we decided to go out for dinner, so we went to the <a
  href="http://www.bordercafe.com/">Border Cafe</a> (warning: totally
  wretched website). We then wandered around Harvard Square a bit and
  stumbled into <a href="http://www.newburycomics.com/">Newbury Comics</a>,
  where I bought:

  I've already read DMZ Volume 7, and I think it is the best volume of the
  series so far by a big margin. The volume is bookended with two incredibly
  touching stories, with Zee (my favorite character) making an appearance.
  The very first story had some echoes, for me, of the way front-line
  soldiers sometimes behaved during the civil war towards their counterparts
  in the opposing trenches. Highly recommended all around.
