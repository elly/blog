An improvement to my identity system
<p>
  A proposal by Liz to extend my <a href="#2011.246.48162">identity
  system</a> with detached signatures, since this allows us to feed the
  identity files directly into a Lisp interpreter.
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>signatures</b>: Each value is a URL, as a string, at which the
      signature of the latest version of the identity file can be fetched.
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, I propose that Lisp comments (i.e., lines beginning with
  ';') be allowed outside the person form to explain nonstandard URL schemas
  and other oddities.
