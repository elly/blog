Cyberpunk Married
<p>
  Liz and I are now totally Cyberpunk Married. We just got a shared email
  account and a shared PGP key (A144FEF64DD8785E3073E9FA661E5F76AD899041).

  Also, we have totally planned a simple and restrained wedding. Twenty-five
  people, a forty-five minute ceremony, and then we repair to a restaurant
  for delicious celebratory dinner. I'm looking forward to it, which it
  seems the wedding industry would have you believe is illegal or something.
