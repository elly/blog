Strange dreams, lots of books
<p>
  Two very strange dreams today: I dreamt that Liz and I were going to
  visit some friends I didn't remember, but it was very late at night and
  we had to be in to work early the next day for some reason, but Liz
  insisted that it was okay, and then the dream ended when we got there
  (?), and the other was that I was an NGO worker in North Korea and fell
  in love with my interpreter/minder and ended up not being able to help
  her escape.

  I got sixty or so pages into
  <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=2LpPYgEACAAJ">Beyond Shelter:
  Architecture and Human Dignity</a>.  It's about how to do long-term
  rebuilding after disasters in such a way that the communities are
  better-prepared for the next disaster. There's a sharp contrast of
  methods: traditional aid agencies often focus on the short term,
  parachuting in teams of volunteers and massive amounts of food, water,
  medicine, and emergency shelter, whereas the approach the author espouses
  (in addition to the traditional one, not in replacement of it!) involves
  sending a couple of engineer/architects to live with the community
  they're helping repair for a period of years to help the residents
  rebuild on their own. The author believes this allows the local people to
  retain their dignity in a way that the other approach doesn't.

  I got four other books yesterday:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=3zdFSOS3f4AC">God Created The Integers</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=zz_ippxyHE4C">The Little Black Book of Style</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=sSgzHayrDBsC">Complexity: A Guided Tour</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://nplusonemag.com/">n+1 Number Twelve</a></li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  I sort of went on a randomized shopping spree at our local bookstore (
  <a href="http://www.portersquarebooks.com/">Porter Square Books</a>).
  Fashion and architecture have always been a little bit fascinating to me,
  not least because I don't really know anything about them, n+1 looked
  really interesting from a casual flip-through, and the other two - well,
  I'm just a sucker for math and system design and analysis.
