Rain
<p>
  I woke up earlier than usual to the sound of falling rain in the huge tree
  just outside, and it's still raining pretty heavily now. I'm feeling
  basically no desire to get out of bed with Liz and go to work, although I
  probably should. I think I've been not getting enough sleep lately, which
  is making me markedly less effective at work, but I am not quite sure how
  to fix it, since as far as I can tell I'm going to sleep early enough and
  so on. I'm certainly less tired today than I have been previously, so I
  think going to bed about 2230 and waking up whenever I wake up works for
  me, although there is the confounding factor of

  waking us up basically whenever she feels like it.

  Liz reports that she is in my base, and "[I] will not believe what she's
  doing to my dudes."

  I'm halfway through <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=SxttzgAACAAJ">
  Magic Knight Rayearth</a> (volume 1, I think, although it's not marked as
  such). It's adorable, and there's a lot of power-of-friendship plot going
  on - in particular, magic in Cefiro (the world they're in) is powered by
  emotions and belief, so it seems that anyone can become an incredibly
  strong sorceror when sufficiently worked up. As a plot device, this makes
  an excellent excuse for a lot of <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">
  unstoppable rage</a>. That said, it's cute, and I'd recommend it, even to
  people who don't otherwise read Manga.

  To work we go!
