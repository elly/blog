V for Vendetta
<p>
  I finished <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=u31IPgAACAAJ">V For
  Vendetta</a> today (the graphic novel, not the novelization of the movie
  (!)). It was every bit as brilliant as I'd been lead to believe, and the
  relationship between order and chaos and anarchy and authority is much
  more fleshed-out. In general, from the movie I got a kind of hooliganish
  "smash stuff!" message, whereas the book is much more of an actual
  anarchist tract - a lot of attention is paid to the constructive side of
  anarchy and the question of what comes _after_ the smashing.

  I've been listening to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireflight">
  Fireflight</a>'s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcRMNiZtj5s">
  For Those Who Wait</a> basically all day now. Something about the song
  really strikes me. I really like the lead singer's voice - she's amazing
  on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWRJAHaOrYg">Unbreakable</a>
  too.

  Next book up: Magic Knight Rayearth. I picked it up off the shelf at
  random yesterday. After that, I think I'll try one of the books I picked
  up on 2011.246. I really like the feeling of having a queue of books to
  read - it keeps me from doing things that are bad for my mind like gaming,
  since I can always think to myself "I do have that book to read...". I'm
  still a bit on the fence about ebooks; they're very convenient, but
  nothing they can do replicates the sensation of standing in a bookstore
  and just browsing through the shelves, feeling the stories hidden behind
  the spines. A Softer World's <a href="http://asofterworld.com/index.php?id=701">
  take</a> on this is very good too.
</p>

<p>
  Ahh, now I've got myself reading A Softer World again. A few of these
  stick out to me right now. I hope that my <a href="http://asofterworld.com/index.php?id=704">
  passion</a> never leaves me, either for Liz or for writing code, and I
  really like this one: <a href="http://asofterworld.com/index.php?id=709">
  I love you the way a knife loves a heart / the way a bomb loves a crowd /
  the way your mother warned you about, essentially.</a>
</p>

<p>
  I think that's a good thought to end on. Think about the way knives love
  hearts, and the way bombs love crowds; what is it to love a person that
  way?
