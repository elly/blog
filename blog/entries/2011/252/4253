A little fix for the distributed-cloud idea
<p>
  A friend points out a problem with my previous design: a third party can DoS
  you by adding arbitrarily many nodes claiming your identifier that will never
  authenticate to you. You can fix this with a little protocol tweak: when the
  first node with a given identifier registers with the centralized frontend, it
  sends it a pair (N, E_k(N)), where N is a nonce and k is the secret shared
  among all of the user's instances. The centralized service sends putative new
  clients with that identifier E_k(N) and requires them to reply with N, which
  filters out junk clients before they get a chance to appear in the peer list
  for that identifier.
